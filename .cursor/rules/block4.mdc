BLOCK 4 — Frontend & UX (add to Project Rules)

Rule 16 — Uniform loading / error / empty states

Do: Every data widget shows skeleton → error with retry → empty state.

Why: No blank screens; better UX.

Rule 17 — File size budgets

Do: Pages < 150 lines; widgets/components < 200 lines. If larger, split.

Why: Maintains clarity and AI tool performance.

Rule 18 — Top-nav controls the page

Do: Changing model/date in top nav must refresh all widgets consistently.

Why: Predictable, unified UX.

Rule 19 — Heavy tables paginate

Do: Citations/URLs and Prompts use server-side pagination/filtering/sorting.

Why: Fast pages and smaller payloads.

Rule 20 — Drilldowns reuse the same contracts

Do: Domain/prompt drilldowns call the same view/RPC family with extra filters.

Why: Zero duplicate logic.
