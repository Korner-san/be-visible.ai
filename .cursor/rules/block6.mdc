BLOCK 6 — Fit with Your Existing “Senior FE Dev” Rule (add to User Rules)

Rule A — Follow the project Rulebook

Do: Before planning or coding, read /docs/cursor-rules.md and obey all rules above.

Why: Ensures consistent structure and fewer regressions.

Rule B — Brief plan first, then implement

Do: Produce a short, step-by-step plan in plain words, explicitly stating: touched files, required views/RPCs, and how providers[] flows end-to-end. Then implement.

Why: Makes changes predictable and reviewable.

Rule C — No TODOs or placeholders

Do: Deliver complete, working changes (loading/error/empty states included).

Why: Prevents half-finished features.

Rule D — Prefer readability over micro-performance

Do: Small, clear functions, early returns, descriptive names, accessible components.

Why: Maintainability > tiny speed gains.
