## 📊 What Was Built

A complete, production-ready background worker that:

✅ **Runs independently from Vercel** - No timeout constraints  
✅ **Processes all report phases** - Perplexity, Google AI Overview, URL extraction & classification  
✅ **Has built-in resilience** - Individual failures don't kill the entire job  
✅ **Includes automatic scheduling** - Runs daily at 01:00 UTC via built-in cron  
✅ **Provides monitoring endpoints** - Health checks and manual triggers  
✅ **Has comprehensive logging** - Detailed progress tracking  
✅ **Is fully documented** - Complete setup and troubleshooting guides

## 🚀 Quick Deployment (5 Steps)

### Step 1: Gather Environment Variables

From your Vercel deployment (Dashboard → Settings → Environment Variables), copy these values:

- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`
- `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`
- `PERPLEXITY_API_KEY`
- `GOOGLE_API_KEY`
- `GOOGLE_CSE_ID`
- `OPENAI_API_KEY`
- `TAVILY_API_KEY`

### Step 2: (Optional) Test Locally

```bash
cd worker
npm install
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env and add your values
npm run verify    # Verify setup
npm run dev       # Run locally
```

### Step 3: Deploy to Render

**Option A: Using Dashboard (Recommended)**

1. Go to https://dashboard.render.com/
2. Click "New +" → "Background Worker"
3. Connect your GitHub repository
4. Configure:
   - **Name**: `be-visible-worker`
   - **Root Directory**: `worker`
   - **Build Command**: `npm install && npm run build`
   - **Start Command**: `npm start`
   - **Plan**: Starter ($7/month)
5. Add all environment variables from Step 1
6. Click "Create Background Worker"

**Option B: Using Blueprint**

1. Click "New +" → "Blueprint"
2. Select your repository
3. Choose `worker/render.yaml`
4. Add environment variables when prompted

### Step 4: Verify Deployment

```bash
# Replace with your Render worker URL
WORKER_URL="https://be-visible-worker.onrender.com"

# Health check
curl $WORKER_URL/health

# Trigger test run
curl -X POST $WORKER_URL/trigger-daily-reports
```

### Step 5: Verify in Supabase

```sql
SELECT 
  id,
  report_date,
  generated,
  perplexity_status,
  google_ai_overview_status,
  url_processing_status,
  urls_total,
  urls_classified
FROM daily_reports
ORDER BY created_at DESC
LIMIT 5;
```

✅ Success indicators:
- `generated = true`
- `perplexity_status = 'complete'`
- `google_ai_overview_status = 'complete'`
- `url_processing_status = 'complete'` ← **Key success metric**
- `urls_classified > 0` ← **Confirms URL processing works**

## 🔍 Key Features

### 1. Error Resilience

Individual failures don't crash the entire job:

```typescript
// Example: URL processing continues even if some URLs fail
const results = await extractUrlContentBatch(urls)
const successful = results.filter(r => !r.failed)
const failed = results.filter(r => r.failed)

console.log(`✅ Processed: ${successful.length}`)
console.log(`❌ Failed: ${failed.length}`)

// Report still completes with successful URLs
```

### 2. Built-in Cron Scheduler

No external dependencies for scheduling:

```typescript
cron.schedule('0 1 * * *', async () => {
  console.log('⏰ [WORKER] Cron job triggered')
  await generateDailyReports()
}, { timezone: 'UTC' })
```

### 3. Comprehensive Logging

Track every step of the process:

```
🚀 [REPORT GENERATOR] Starting...
📊 [REPORT GENERATOR] Found 1 brand(s)
🔄 [REPORT GENERATOR] Processing brand: Example Corp
🚀 [PERPLEXITY] Starting pass with 15 prompts
✅ [PERPLEXITY] Success - 15/15 prompts
🚀 [GOOGLE AI OVERVIEW] Starting pass
✅ [GOOGLE AI OVERVIEW] Success - 15/15 prompts
🔍 [URL PROCESSOR] Found 47 unique URLs
✅ [URL PROCESSOR] Extracted 45/47 URLs
🤖 [CONTENT CLASSIFIER] Classifying 45 URLs
✅ [URL PROCESSOR] Complete
🎉 [REPORT GENERATOR] Completed successfully
```

### 4. Health Monitoring

Built-in endpoints for monitoring:

```bash
# Health check (for uptime monitoring)
GET /health
→ {"status":"healthy","timestamp":"..."}

# Status check (for debugging)
GET /status
→ {"status":"running","uptime":3600,"cronSchedule":"0 1 * * *"}

# Manual trigger (for testing)
POST /trigger-daily-reports
→ {"success":true,"message":"Started"}
```

## 💰 Cost Breakdown

### Render
- **Starter Plan**: $7/month
  - 512MB RAM
  - 0.5 CPU
  - Sufficient for 1-10 brands

### APIs (per brand, per day)
- Perplexity: ~$0.15 (15 prompts)
- Google Custom Search: ~$0.05 (15 queries)
- OpenAI (GPT-4o-mini): ~$0.10 (URL classification)
- Tavily: ~$0.20 (URL content extraction)
- **Total per report**: ~$0.50

### Monthly (1 brand)
- Render: $7
- APIs: $15 (30 days × $0.50)
- **Total**: ~$22/month

Compare to Vercel Pro ($20/month) + APIs ($15) = $35/month  
**Savings**: $13/month + working URL processing!

## 🎯 Success Criteria

Your migration is complete when:

- [ ] Render worker is deployed and healthy
- [ ] Manual trigger generates a complete report
- [ ] Report has `url_processing_status = 'complete'`
- [ ] URLs have content in `url_content_facts` table
- [ ] Automatic daily run works at 01:00 UTC
- [ ] Vercel app displays reports correctly
- [ ] GitHub Actions workflow is disabled

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Worker not starting
**Check**: Environment variables in Render Dashboard → Environment tab

### Cannot connect to Supabase
**Check**: `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` is correct (not anon key)

### API errors
**Check**: API keys are valid and have sufficient quota

### Reports not generating
**Check**: Worker logs in Render Dashboard → Logs tab

### URL processing failing
**Solution**: Individual URL failures are expected and won't fail the report

## 🎓 Understanding the Architecture

### Before (Vercel) - FAILED
```
GitHub Actions Cron
    ↓
Vercel API: /api/cron/daily-reports
    ↓
Vercel Function: /api/reports/generate-daily
    ↓
Phase 1: Perplexity ✅
Phase 2: Google AI ✅
Phase 3: Aggregate ✅
Phase 4: URL Processing ❌ TIMEOUT
```

### After (Render) - WORKING
```
Render Worker (Built-in Cron)
    ↓
generateDailyReports()
    ↓
For each brand:
    ├─ Phase 1: Perplexity ✅
    ├─ Phase 2: Google AI ✅
    ├─ Phase 3: URL Processing ✅
    │   ├─ Extract URLs
    │   ├─ Fetch content (Tavily)
    │   ├─ Classify (ChatGPT)
    │   └─ Store (Supabase)
    └─ Phase 4: Complete ✅
```

### How Vercel + Render Work Together
```
Users → Vercel App (Frontend)
            ↓
        Supabase DB
            ↑
    Render Worker (Reports)
```

**Key Point**: They're independent services sharing the same database.
