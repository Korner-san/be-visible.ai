✅ [WORKER] Cron job scheduled successfully
```

**Next scheduled run:** October 27, 2025 at 01:00 UTC

---

## 3. Report Generation Flow

The worker executes a **single, connected operation** with these phases:

### Phase 1: Initialization
- Loads test user (`kk1995current@gmail.com`)
- Fetches all brands with active prompts
- Creates or resumes daily report record

### Phase 2: Perplexity Processing
```typescript
// File: worker/src/services/prompt-processor.ts
```
- Sends each of 15 prompts to Perplexity API
- Tracks: `perplexity_attempted`, `perplexity_ok`, `perplexity_no_result`
- Extracts citations from responses
- Stores in `prompt_results` table

### Phase 3: Google AI Overview Processing
```typescript
// File: worker/src/services/prompt-processor.ts
```
- Sends each of 15 prompts to Google Custom Search API
- Tracks: `google_ai_overview_attempted`, `google_ai_overview_ok`, `google_ai_overview_no_result`
- Extracts citations from responses
- Stores in `prompt_results` table

### Phase 4: URL Processing
```typescript
// File: worker/src/services/url-processor.ts
```
- Extracts all unique URLs from citations (both providers)
- Identifies new URLs not yet in `url_inventory`
- For each URL needing processing:
  1. Fetches page content via Tavily API
  2. Classifies content via OpenAI GPT-4o-mini
  3. Stores in `url_content_facts` table
- Tracks: `urls_total`, `urls_extracted`, `urls_classified`

### Phase 5: Domain Homepage Processing (Non-blocking)
```typescript
// File: worker/src/services/url-processor.ts lines 397-531
```
- Identifies unique domains from all citations
- For each domain whose homepage is not yet categorized:
  1. Generates homepage URL (`https://domain.com`)
  2. Fetches homepage content via Tavily
  3. Classifies homepage via OpenAI
  4. Stores in `url_content_facts` table
- **Note:** Runs separately and won't fail the main job if errors occur

### Phase 6: Completion Check
```typescript
// File: worker/src/services/report-generator.ts lines 257-310
```
- Verifies all three phases completed:
  - `perplexity_status = 'complete'`
  - `google_ai_overview_status = 'complete' or 'failed'`
  - `url_processing_status = 'complete'`
- If all complete, sets:
  - `generated = true`
  - `status = 'completed'`
  - `completed_at = NOW()`

---

## 4. Success Condition Logic

**File:** `worker/src/services/report-generator.ts` lines 257-310

A report is marked as `generated = true` when **ALL THREE** conditions are met:

```typescript
const isPerplexityComplete = report.perplexity_status === 'complete'
const isGoogleComplete = ['complete', 'failed'].includes(report.google_ai_overview_status)
const isUrlProcessingComplete = report.url_processing_status === 'complete'

const shouldMarkComplete = isPerplexityComplete && isGoogleComplete && isUrlProcessingComplete
```

**Key Rules:**
1. ✅ Perplexity must attempt all prompts (doesn't require all successful)
2. ✅ Google AI Overview must attempt all prompts (doesn't require all successful)
3. ✅ URL processing must complete (individual URL failures don't fail the job)
4. ✅ System tracks attempts vs successes for transparency
5. ✅ Resilient: individual failures don't cascade to total failure

---

## 5. Homepage Categorization

**File:** `worker/src/services/url-processor.ts` lines 397-531

**Process Flow:**
1. After main URL processing completes
2. Identifies all unique domains from citations
3. For each domain:
   - Checks if homepage (`https://domain.com`) exists in `url_inventory`
   - Checks if homepage has `content_structure_category` classification
4. If homepage needs processing:
   - Fetches homepage via Tavily
   - Classifies via OpenAI
   - Stores in `url_content_facts`
5. **Non-blocking:** Homepage processing errors don't fail the main job

**Example:**
```
Citation: https://example.com/blog/article-123
Domain: example.com
Homepage: https://example.com

If homepage not yet classified:
  1. Fetch https://example.com via Tavily
  2. Classify via OpenAI
  3. Store classification
  
Then: Process the deep URL (article-123)
```

## 6. Current Database State

### Recent Reports (October 20-26)

| Date | Perplexity | Google AI | URLs | Generated | System |
|------|------------|-----------|------|-----------|--------|
| Oct 26 | ❌ 0/15 | ✅ 14/15 | ⏸️ Not Started | ❌ false | Old (Vercel) |
| Oct 25 | ❌ 0/15 | ✅ 14/15 | ⏸️ Not Started | ❌ false | Old (Vercel) |
| Oct 24 | ✅ 15/15 | ✅ 14/15 | ✅ 137/140 | ❌ false | Old (Vercel) |
| Oct 23 | ✅ 15/15 | ✅ 14/15 | ✅ 138/142 | ❌ false | Old (Vercel) |
| Oct 22 | ✅ 15/15 | ✅ 14/15 | ✅ 144/149 | ❌ false | Old (Vercel) |
| Oct 21 | ✅ 15/15 | ✅ 14/15 | ✅ 118/152 | ✅ **true** | Old (Vercel) |
| Oct 20 | ✅ 15/15 | ✅ 14/15 | ✅ 11/11 | ✅ **true** | Old (Vercel) |

### Issues Identified

**🚨 October 22-24:** Reports completed successfully but `generated` remained `false`
- **Cause:** Bug in old Vercel system's completion check logic
- **Fixed in:** New Render worker has corrected logic
- **Action:** These reports can be manually updated if needed, or left as historical data

**🚨 October 25-26:** Perplexity API failing (0/15 successful)
- **Cause:** Unknown - could be API key issue, rate limiting, or API service problem
- **Impact:** No URL processing runs because no citations collected
- **Action:** Monitor tonight's Render worker run to see if issue persists

**Note:** All these reports were generated by the **old Vercel/GitHub Actions system**. The Render worker has not yet run its first automatic execution.

---

## 7. System Architecture

### Before Migration (Until Oct 26)
```
GitHub Actions Cron (01:00 UTC)
    ↓
Vercel API: /api/cron/daily-reports
    ↓
Vercel Function: /api/reports/generate-daily
    ↓
Problems:
  - Timeout constraints (5-10 minutes)
  - URL processing caused failures
  - No reports since Oct 21
```

### After Migration (Oct 26+)
```
Render Background Worker
  └─ Built-in cron (01:00 UTC)
      ↓
  generateDailyReports()
      ↓
  ┌─ Phase 1: Perplexity (15 prompts)
  ├─ Phase 2: Google AI (15 prompts)
  ├─ Phase 3: URL Processing (all citations)
  │   ├─ Extract content (Tavily)
  │   ├─ Classify content (OpenAI)
  │   └─ Store (Supabase)
  ├─ Phase 4: Homepage Processing (non-blocking)
  └─ Phase 5: Mark complete

Advantages:
  ✅ No timeout limits
  ✅ Error resilience
  ✅ Complete logging
  ✅ Lower cost ($7 vs $20/month)
```

### How Frontend Access Reports
```
Vercel Frontend App
    ↓
Supabase Database
    ↑
Render Worker (generates reports)

Both systems share the same database.
Frontend automatically displays reports generated by worker.
```

---

## 8. Old System Status

**GitHub Actions Workflow:** ✅ Fully disabled  
**File:** `.github/workflows/daily-reports.yml`  
**Status:** Entire workflow commented out (won't trigger)  
**Commit:** `00917cb` - "fix: fully disable GitHub Actions cron workflow"

**Old Vercel API Routes:** Still exist but unused
- `/app/api/cron/daily-reports/route.ts`
- `/app/api/reports/generate-daily/route.ts`

**Recommendation:** Keep old routes for historical reference and emergency manual triggers if needed.

---

## 9. Monitoring & Verification

### Worker Health Check
```bash
# Worker exposes localhost endpoints (not publicly accessible)
# Check via Render Dashboard logs instead
```

### Render Dashboard
- **URL:** https://dashboard.render.com/worker/srv-d3v0f4ur433s73chrf6g
- **Logs:** Real-time view of worker execution
- **Manual Trigger:** Use Render's shell to restart worker

### Supabase Verification Query
```sql
SELECT 
  report_date,
  generated,
  perplexity_status,
  google_ai_overview_status,
  url_processing_status,
  perplexity_attempted,
  perplexity_ok,
  google_ai_overview_attempted,
  google_ai_overview_ok,
  urls_total,
  urls_extracted,
  urls_classified
FROM daily_reports
WHERE report_date >= CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '7 days'
ORDER BY report_date DESC;
```

### Success Indicators for October 27 Report
- ✅ `generated = true`
- ✅ `status = 'completed'`
- ✅ `perplexity_status = 'complete'`
- ✅ `google_ai_overview_status = 'complete'`
- ✅ `url_processing_status = 'complete'`
- ✅ `perplexity_ok > 0` (ideally 15)
- ✅ `google_ai_overview_ok > 0` (typically 14)
- ✅ `urls_classified > 0`

## 11. Troubleshooting Guide

### If Tonight's Report Fails

**1. Check Render Logs**
```
Dashboard → Worker → Logs tab
Look for error messages and stack traces
```

**2. Check Supabase Report**
```sql
SELECT * FROM daily_reports 
WHERE report_date = '2025-10-27'
ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 1;
```

**3. Common Issues & Solutions**

| Issue | Diagnosis | Solution |
|-------|-----------|----------|
| Perplexity fails | `perplexity_ok = 0` | Check API key, quotas, service status |
| Google fails | `google_ai_overview_ok = 0` | Check API key, CSE ID, quotas |
| URLs not processed | `url_processing_status = 'failed'` | Check Tavily/OpenAI keys, quotas |
| Worker doesn't run | No logs at 01:00 UTC | Check Render service status, restart |
| Wrong timezone | Reports at wrong time | Verify `timezone: 'UTC'` in cron config |

## 12. Cost Analysis

### Before Migration (Vercel)
- Vercel Pro: $20/month (needed for longer timeouts, but still failed)
- APIs: ~$15/month per brand
- **Total:** $35/month + $15 per brand

### After Migration (Render)
- Render Starter: $7/month
- APIs: ~$15/month per brand (same)
- **Total:** $22/month + $15 per brand

**Savings:** $13/month + **working URL processing**
