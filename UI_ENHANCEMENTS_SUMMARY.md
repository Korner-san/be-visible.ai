## üìã Changes Summary

### 1. ‚úÖ Citations Page - Domain Table (Main Table)

**Content Type Column Hover Text - UPDATED**

**Before:**
```
"Type of content most commonly cited from this domain (e.g. Guide, Forum, Blog)."
```

**After:**
```
"Type of content most commonly cited from this domain (e.g. Guide, Forum, Blog).

This content type represents the classification of the domain's homepage."
```

**Where Applied:**
- Main table header (line 293-296)
- Domain row Content Type badge hover (line 360-363)

**Behavior:**
- Each domain row represents the domain's homepage
- Content Type shows the homepage's classification
- If no homepage category exists: shows "Not categorized yet"
- Homepage URLs are filtered out of the dropdown (already implemented in backend)

---

### 2. ‚úÖ Citations Page - URL Table (Dropdown/Expanded Table)

**Content Type Column Hover Text - UPDATED**

**Before:**
```
"Type of content for this specific URL (e.g. Guide, Forum, Blog)."
```

**After:**
```
"Type of content for this specific URL (e.g. Guide, Forum, Blog).

This content type represents the classification of the specific URL listed in this table (not the domain homepage)."
```

**Where Applied:**
- URL table header (line 424-427)
- URL row Content Type badge hover (line 477-480)

**Behavior:**
- Only internal/deep URLs appear (homepage filtered out)
- Each URL's Content Type shows its specific classification
- Clear distinction from domain-level homepage classification

---

### 3. ‚úÖ Content Structure Page - New "Total URLs" Column

**New Column Added:** `Total URLs`

**Position:** Between "Unique URLs" and "% of Total"

**Column Header:**
```
Total URLs (with hover icon)
```

**Hover Text:**
```
"Total number of URLs scanned from citations during the selected date range. This helps compare daily and period-to-period content variability."
```

**Data Source:**
- API returns `totalScans` field
- Counts ALL citation appearances (includes duplicates)
- Different from `count` (Unique URLs) which deduplicates

**Example:**
```
Content Type          | Unique URLs | Total URLs | % of Total
---------------------|-------------|------------|------------
Blog Post            |     63      |    156     |   45.2%
Official Docs        |     17      |     89     |   25.8%
Tutorial             |     17      |     45     |   13.0%
```

**Interpretation:**
- Unique URLs = 63 different blog posts cited
- Total URLs = 156 total citations of those blogs (some cited multiple times)
- Helps identify which content gets repeatedly cited

## ‚úÖ Acceptance Criteria - All Met

### ‚úÖ Main Table Shows Homepage Classification
- Content Type column displays homepage's `domain_category`

- Homepage URLs filtered out by backend (already implemented)
- Only internal/deep URLs displayed
- Hover text clearly states "not the domain homepage"

### ‚úÖ Content Type Hover Text Clarifies Context

### ‚úÖ Content Structure Page Has Total URLs Column
- New column added between "Unique URLs" and "% of Total"
- Shows total citation count (not deduplicated)
- Hover text: "Total number of URLs scanned from citations during the selected date range..."

### ‚úÖ No Backend Logic Changed

## üß™ Testing After Deployment

### Test 1: Citations Page - Domain Table
1. Go to Reports ‚Üí Citations
2. Select Oct 27 (or any date with data)
3. **Verify:** Domain table loads
4. **Hover over "Content Type" header**
   - Should see: "...This content type represents the classification of the domain's homepage."
5. **Hover over any domain's Content Type badge**
   - Should see the description + "...This content type represents the classification of the domain's homepage."

### Test 2: Citations Page - URL Dropdown
1. Click any domain to expand URLs
2. **Verify:** Homepage URL NOT in list (e.g., no `https://example.com/` only deep URLs)
3. **Hover over "Content Type" header in dropdown**
   - Should see: "...This content type represents the classification of the specific URL listed in this table (not the domain homepage)."
4. **Hover over any URL's Content Type badge**
   - Should see description + "...This content type represents the classification of the specific URL listed in this table (not the domain homepage)."

### Test 3: Content Structure Page - Total URLs Column
1. Go to Reports ‚Üí Content
2. Select date range (Oct 27 or Last 7 days)
3. **Verify:** Table shows columns in order:
   - Content Structure
   - Unique URLs
   - **Total URLs** ‚Üê NEW
   - % of Total
   - Primary Intent
   - Avg. Longevity
4. **Hover over "Total URLs" header**
   - Should see: "Total number of URLs scanned from citations during the selected date range. This helps compare daily and period-to-period content variability."
5. **Verify:** Total URLs ‚â• Unique URLs (can be same if no duplicates)

## üìà Expected Data Examples

### Content Structure Page

**Example for Oct 27:**
```
Content Type                    | Unique URLs | Total URLs | % of Total
-------------------------------|-------------|------------|------------
Blog Post                      |     63      |    156     |   45.2%
Official Documentation         |     17      |     89     |   25.8%
Product Comparison            |      9      |     34     |    9.9%
Tutorial                       |     17      |     45     |   13.0%
```

**What This Tells Us:**
- 63 unique blog posts were cited
- Those 63 blogs were cited 156 times total (some cited multiple times)
- Blog posts account for 45.2% of all citations
- Avg. 2.5 citations per blog post (156/63)

**Why This Matters:**
- Identifies which content types get repeatedly cited by AI models
- Helps prioritize content creation (high Total/Unique ratio = AI loves it)
- Tracks changes over time (Last 7 days vs Last 30 days)
